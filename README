= About =
SyslogBot is a jabber/xmpp bot to deliver messages from named pipes to some given JIDs, MUCs or all people connected to the bot. It is written with the python-jabberbot framework in Python. Both JIDs and named pipes can be configured.

The main idea is to replace logcheck which sends all new log messages of the last time per email to the administrator. SyslogBot delivers syslog messages over jabber/xmpp to the administrators in nearly real time. It is designed to deliver syslog messages from a named pipe, but you can send any kind message of any program to syslogBot.

= Dependencies =
 - Python2
 - python-jabberbot > 0.10
 - a jabber account for the bot


= Setup =
For configuration details please look at the example config file.
You have to setup the jabber account and password and a named pipe group.

A named pipe group setups jids and named pipes. All messages received by one of the pipes will be delivered to the specified jids.

It is possible to setup as many named pipe groups as you want.

== Message filtering ==
SyslogBot doesn't support any message filtering. Insead of that you have to configure your syslog daemon to only deliver messages you want to the name pipe. This needs much less system resources than a python based regex filtering. Syslog-ng and rsyslog have built in support for message filtering, which is really easy to configure. So there is no need for an extra filtering in SyslogBot.
